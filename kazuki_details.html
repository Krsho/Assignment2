        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Kazuki Takahashi - A Journey Through Manga</h2>
    
        <p>At the age of 20, Kazuki Takahashi took his first step into the world of manga. In 1981, his one-shot manga <em>Ing! Love Ball</em>, written under the pen name "Hajime Miyabi" (雅はじめ, Miyabi Hajime), won the prestigious Shogakukan New Comic Award. This marked his debut in the manga scene, and it was published in *Weekly Shōnen Sunday* the same year.</p>
    
        <p>His career truly began to take shape in 1986 when he made his serial debut with <em>Gō-Q-Chōji Ikkiman</em>, a manga adaptation of a TV sports anime. This series was published in *Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine* and helped Takahashi gain early recognition. Despite this, Takahashi faced significant financial hardships during this time. He lived in a dilapidated apartment, as described by his fellow manga artist, George Morikawa, and often struggled with extreme poverty, even lacking electricity in his home. He shared in interviews that during this time, he had to make credit card payments multiple times just to keep his work published.</p>
    
        <p>Despite these challenges, Takahashi’s resilience led him to switch his focus to *Shueisha*, which would prove to be a turning point in his career. In 1990, he published another one-shot manga, <em>Tokiō no Taka</em>, in *Weekly Shōnen Jump*. This was followed by the serial *Tennenshoku Danji Buray*, which ran from 1991 to 1992.</p>
    
        <p>But it was in 1996 that Takahashi truly changed the world of manga with the creation of <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong>. Serialized in *Weekly Shōnen Jump*, the series took the world by storm, introducing fans to the legendary card game and captivating storytelling. The manga ran until 2004, selling over 40 million copies. It wasn’t just a hit in Japan; *Yu-Gi-Oh!* received several adaptations, including an anime television series and a trading card game developed by Konami. The trading card game itself achieved legendary status, breaking records and securing the Guinness World Record for the best-selling trading card game in history, with more than 25.1 billion cards sold by 2011.</p>
    
        <p>After the original manga’s serialization ended, Takahashi remained involved in the franchise. He supervised the adaptations created by his assistants, including <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! R</em> by Akira Itō, <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</em> by Naoyuki Kageyama, and <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</em> by Masashi Sato. Additionally, he contributed to the anime, playing a key role in the production of *Yu-Gi-Oh! Bonds Beyond Time* and *Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions*.</p>
    
        <p>Though Takahashi’s influence on the manga industry is undeniable, his creative journey didn’t stop with *Yu-Gi-Oh!*. In 2013, he released the one-shot manga <em>Drump</em>, which was published in *Weekly Shōnen Jump*. His work was recognized globally when he received the Inkpot Award in 2015 for his outstanding contributions to comics. In 2018, Takahashi returned with the limited series <em>The Comiq</em>, and in 2019, he worked on a two-part manga titled <em>Secret Reverse</em>, created for the Marvel × Shōnen Jump+ Super Collaboration, released on *Shōnen Jump+*.</p>
